### Hello 👋✌️ 🤙 

CS student interested in various things, including web development, backend, devops, AI, and more.

A quick summary of some of the things that I worked on before:
* 🤖 https://github.com/teabolt/gsoc19-eli5-gradcam - as part of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2019 added explanations of neural networks to the [ELI5](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/eli5) Python machine learning library.
* 🌍 https://prosearch.tomasb.ie/ - a website that lets you search through past DCU CS and Engineering final year student projects. Based on [scraped PDF's](https://github.com/teabolt/dcu_eng_comp_projects_dataset) and a [React](https://github.com/teabolt/dcu_project_search_frontend)—[Node](https://github.com/teabolt/dcu_project_search_backend)—[ElasticSearch](https://github.com/teabolt/dcu_project_search_elasticsearch) stack. [Deployed](https://github.com/teabolt/dcu_project_search_deployment) on AWS/DigitalOcean.
* 🎓  https://github.com/teabolt/dcu_case_1721 - my course work from year 1 to year 4 in DCU, including [Erasmus](https://github.com/teabolt/dcu_case_1721/tree/master/year3_1920/epitech) and [third year project](https://github.com/distributedcloudproject/2020-ca326-tbaltrunas-cloudstorage)
* 📱  https://github.com/darkopoppin/DDash - a rough attempt to make an Android app that gathers information about the device it is running on, such as device memory, storage, etc.
* ⚠️ https://github.com/teabolt/vue-sec - a quick example of a Vue.js app that bypasses security recommendations and is susceptible to XSS/SQL injection attacks.
* 🃏 https://github.com/teabolt/solitaire.android.ai - an attempt to automate the playing of the Android game Solitaire. Built using Python with OpenCV to detect playing cards and Jython with Monkeyrunner to interact with the mobile device. Unfortunately we only drag the cards down instead of actually playing the game.
* 🐩 https://github.com/teabolt/poodle.scrape - a scrapy Python web scraper that retrieves a logged in student's submissions and task descriptions from the DCU year 2 object-oriented programming and data structures & algorithms course site.
* 📝 https://github.com/teabolt/noteScrape - a Python web scraper based on Selenium (browser automator) that retrieves a student's submissions to DCU year 1 programming course sites.
* 📄 https://github.com/teabolt/exam-tk - yet another Selenium-based Python scraper for retrieving exam papers from the DCU website. Also a command-line utility for manipulating the PDF's in various ways (cutting pages and recombining).
* 🖨️ https://github.com/teabolt/job-scraper - a very quick and limited Python scraper for "jobs.ie"
